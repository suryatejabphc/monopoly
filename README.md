This is a machine learning project for Monopoly game simulation to observe the wealth allocation in the game of Monopoly

Monopoly is a zero-sum game. Each person gets an equal amount of money and access to the properties they land on, to buy them unless someone else did it first.
This is in a way a replica of the real world. Wealth accumulation is a process that takes a lot of risks and is rewarded as such. Wealth is unequally accumulated.

Those who have get more, despite the redistribution. This particular code looks at doing that simulation across 5 - 20 players to observe the wealth accumulation
